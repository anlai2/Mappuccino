# Mappuccino
React Native Application that allows users to find nearby coffee shops in a UI friendly manner.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. In the terminal, run npm install in the project folder. This should download all the dependencies and libraries we are using.
3. Download Expo on (https://expo.io/).
4. Run the project folder in Expo. 
5. Run the project in an emulator or download the Expo app on your physical device. If using an emulator, 
click the device button at the top right and open in either emulator. If using a physical device download Expo and sign up for
an Expo account. If you have a physical android device you can just scan the QR code on the share button in the desktop app.
If you have a physical iOS device, you can put your phone number in and it will send you a link to open the project.

If any errors come up, it can be easily fixed through googling the error. If anything message Andy on Slack.
